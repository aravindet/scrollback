### Scrollback Modules

Scrollback contains independent modules that talk to each other. They are based on the [Unix philosophy "Write programs that do one thing and do it well"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Doug_McIlroy_on_Unix_programming). Each module specialises in one functionality say like storage or authentication or search and so on.

Modules follow the [pub-sub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishâ€“subscribe_pattern
) (short for publisher-subscriber) pattern. These modules have n:n mapping that is, any module can pub-sub to any module.

The following are brief descriptions about the modules in use:
